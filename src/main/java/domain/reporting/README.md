# Reporting Domain
This sub-domain handles the generation of reports about prescriptions and drug usage.
It provides aggregated statistics such as the number of prescriptions for a given DIN,
quantities dispensed, and reporting by period.

This is a **Supporting Domain**, since reporting supports decision-making and pharmacy management,
but it is not at the heart of the prescription process.
