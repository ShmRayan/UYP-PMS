# Security Domain
This sub-domain manages authentication and access control within the system.
It ensures that only authorized agents and administrators can access sensitive data
and perform actions such as registering patients or validating prescriptions.

This is a **Generic Domain**, because security and authentication are common to many systems
and not unique to the pharmacy prescription management domain.
