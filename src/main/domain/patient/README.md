# Patient Domain
This sub-domain manages the registration and update of patients in the system.
It includes capturing patient information such as name, date of birth, address,
and provincial health number.

This is a **Supporting Domain**, as patient data is required for creating and managing prescriptions
but it is not the core business value of the system by itself.
